            <p>This continues to be my favourite, Endgame was also good but this was certainly better for me. I guess I enjoy the whole Marvel concept. Its tough to expect every movie to be a hit, 
                but  super powers aside, the way they link them together like they do in the comics is so awesome for me. They have my Favourite Characters in Spider Man and now Iron Man, Captain America
                and Black Panther I guess. I also somehow like tht they lose and Thanos gets his way. It's not always good news. 
                In conclusion - This is an epic movie followed by another epic movie, just not as epic as the first in my eyes. 
                  </p>

    <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0765429/">
        
            <h3><li>American Gangster</li> </h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/American Gangster Poster.png" height="100" 
            alt="American Gangster Poster"/>

            <p>Denzel Washington is such a badass in this movie. I'm used to seeing him in distiguished roles or honourable roles. 
                Seeing him as an upstanding gangster was a change for me. I like to see realistic action too and this seemed as I would imagine.
                Really any movie with Denzel is gonna be good and the girls can also enjoy it... </p>

    <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_shawshank">
        <h3><li>Shawshank Redemption</li></h3>

            <p>This is an old classic which has always been a winner for me. I think I have about 3 copies as I kept buying it and realised I had it Doh!
                I think most people like a gripping movie with a twisty ending, but this one takes the cake!I should probably watch it again just to remind myself of how good a movie it is.  </p>
                But without even a recent watch, I can tell it still gets me excited just thinking about it.
