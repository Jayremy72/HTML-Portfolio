</p>



<p>Jeremy was raised in London by his two parents, John and Veronica (who decend from the small Caribbean Island of Montserrat) and brother to Robert John Alexander Burns. 
  He left school to pursue motor vehicle engineering as an apprentice with Volvo Cars, but was made redundant after 18 months, 
  however, he continued with is BTec course to become fully certified. Following this, Jeremy went on to Middlesex University to complete a 4 year course and obtain a BEng Mechanical Engineering degree with honours. 
  There was little luck with employment following that, so when presented with an opportunity at MTV Networks Europe, Jeremy changed vocation.</p>

<p>Jeremy was always involved with music and entertainment, starting with his Uncle at Mono Entertainment, where he learned about staging events and music curation, 
  while at Middlesex University Jeremy was Entertainments Officer for the Student Union for a number of years, 
  but also as an avid TV viewer it became very clear that MTV was a good choice for him.</p>

<p>Starting in the Music Video Library, Jeremy learnt the key elements of production, logging tapes and understanding footage and content structure and storage. 
  He moved into Channel Presentation with MTV North (Scandinavia) and as the company itself developed and centralised, 
 he progressed quickly into Channel Planning with Paris based Team MTV France. From London, he managed a team of 3 (Music Programming On Air and Channel Operations). This role lasted until 2001 when the role fully relocated to Paris from the London HQ.</p>

<p>After some freelance Presentation Scheduling roles at The Walt Disney Company, Jeremy moved on to Discovery Communication International to work on the EMEA channels and was again quickly assigned as Acting Programming Manager for Discovery Italia.
  This was another role that was relocating to the region, this time to Rome and so after a thorough handover, Jeremy resumed his previous London based role where he was able to increase ratings by 188% YoY through innovative planning and strategy techniques.</p>

<p>In 2006 MTV (now owned by Viacom) came calling, but this time with an opportunity in the newly developing Africa business. The strategy was “Reimagine Africa” with a plan to change the global perception of Africas entertainment industry and develop skills and talent across the continent.
  Jeremy joined the Programming and Scheduling team as a London based member and while the rest of the team relocated to Johannesburg, Jeremy was left to run and develop the overall Programming, Channel Operations and Transmission for the network.</p>

<p>After relocating to join the Johannesburg team in 2009, Jeremy learnt a great deal about African culture, music and entertainment and the differences across the continent. 
  He had great involvement in the development of much of the local content for MTV Base Africa, including MTV Africa Music Awards (MAMA), Hip Hop Roundtable (Hottest MCs in the Game), MTV Shuga, Sucker Free Countdown, MTV Base Road To Africa, among others.
  He also liaised closely with Sales, Commercial and Marketing departments to deliver award winning commercial and advertising content and strategy through themed programming, international content acquisition and local content development that supported the various clients marketing and advertising requirements. 
  MTV Africa grew significantly between 2009 and 2015 on the success of MTV Base, where they were able to launch new channel brands in the market including Comedy Central, BET, Nickelodeon and Paramount.</p>

<p>In 2016 Jeremy launched The Jerk Company, an authentic Caribbean cuisine brand. Using his learnings from broadcasting and engineering, he developed recipes and processes creating a food offering like no other in the region. 
  After an unplanned break for Covid-19 in 2020, the restaurant returned in 2023 with a return to the street food scene.</p>

<p>Jeremy is planning to launch a number of new brands and businesses with business partners Ivanson’s Consulting, including FoodLAN, a catering and food delivery business. Jeremy has also been learning Web Development, Digital Marketing and Content Marketing and Strategy.</p>

<p>In early 2013 Jeremy met his life partner Lindiwe Florence Rebecca Bardill and 2014 saw the birth of their first child Ayana Naledi Lucy Burns, followed in 2021 by the birth of Imani Grace Nozipho Burns.
